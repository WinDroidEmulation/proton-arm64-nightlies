Comment out only patches that are either:
- intentionally handled by local fix scripts, or
- already merged into Valve bleeding-edge with stable identifying markers.

Everything else stays in build-step-arm64ec.sh so patch_build_script.py can
attempt a real apply/reverse-check/3way merge instead of being skipped on weak
heuristics.

Usage: filter_patches.py <build-script-path> <wine-source-path>
